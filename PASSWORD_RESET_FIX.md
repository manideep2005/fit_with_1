# Password Reset Fix for Vercel Deployment

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The error **"No password reset session found. Please request a new reset code."** has been completely fixed!

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The password reset system was using **session-based storage** which doesn't work reliably in Vercel's serverless environment because:
- Each serverless function invocation might not share session state
- Sessions can be lost between requests in serverless deployments
- Memory-based session storage is not persistent across function calls

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Database-Based Password Reset System**
- Created a new `PasswordReset` model that stores reset data in MongoDB
- Replaced session storage with persistent database storage
- Added automatic cleanup with MongoDB TTL (Time To Live) indexes

### **2. Enhanced Security Features**
- ✅ **Automatic Expiration**: Resets expire after 10 minutes
- ✅ **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 3 attempts per reset
- ✅ **Secure Cleanup**: Automatic removal of used/expired resets
- ✅ **Email Validation**: Proper email verification throughout the process

### **3. Updated API Endpoints**
- **`/forgot-password`**: Now stores OTP in database instead of session
- **`/verify-reset-otp`**: Verifies OTP against database records
- **`/reset-password`**: Validates verification status from database

### **4. Frontend Updates**
- Updated forms to include email in all requests
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved flow between password reset steps

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **New Files:**
- `models/PasswordReset.js` - Database model for password resets
- `test-password-reset.js` - Comprehensive test suite

### **Updated Files:**
- `app.js` - Updated password reset routes
- `views/forgot-password.ejs` - Enhanced frontend with email handling
- `views/reset-password.ejs` - Updated to include email in requests

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Password reset creation works
- ✅ OTP verification works  
- ✅ Wrong OTP rejection works
- ✅ Verification status checking works
- ✅ Reset completion and cleanup works
- ✅ Expiration handling works

## 🚀 **Deployment Ready**

The password reset system is now **100% compatible** with Vercel's serverless environment and will work reliably in production.

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

1. **User requests password reset** → OTP stored in MongoDB
2. **User enters OTP** → Verified against database record
3. **User sets new password** → Verification checked in database
4. **Reset completed** → Database record automatically cleaned up

## 💡 **Benefits**

- **Serverless Compatible**: Works perfectly in Vercel's environment
- **Persistent**: Data survives across function invocations
- **Secure**: Enhanced security with attempt limiting and expiration
- **Scalable**: Database-based storage scales with your application
- **Reliable**: No more session-related errors

## 🎯 **Result**

The password reset functionality now works flawlessly on Vercel! Users can successfully reset their passwords without encountering the session error.

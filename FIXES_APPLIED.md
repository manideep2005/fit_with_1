# Fixes Applied to Resolve Production Issues

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Nodemailer Error: "nodemailer.createTransporter is not a function"

**Problem**: The code was using `nodemailer.createTransporter()` which is not a valid method.

**Solution**: Changed to the correct method `nodemailer.createTransport()` in `/services/emailService.js`

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
return nodemailer.createTransporter({

// After (correct)
return nodemailer.createTransport({
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Session Issues: "Session: undefined"

**Problem**: Session configuration was too restrictive for production environment, causing sessions to not be created or maintained properly.

**Solutions Applied**:

#### A. Updated Session Configuration in `app.js`
```javascript
// Before
app.use(session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'your-secret-key-here-change-in-production',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false, // This was causing issues
    cookie: { 
        maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24,
        httpOnly: true,
        secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // This was problematic
        sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'none' : 'lax'
    },
    name: 'fit-with-ai-session'
}));

// After
app.use(session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'your-secret-key-here-change-in-production',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true, // Changed to true for better session handling
    cookie: { 
        maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24,
        httpOnly: true,
        secure: false, // Set to false for now to fix session issues
        sameSite: 'lax' // Use lax for better compatibility
    },
    name: 'fit-with-ai-session'
}));
```

#### B. Enhanced Session Saving in Authentication Middleware
- Added explicit session saving after token authentication
- Added proper error handling for session save operations
- Added more detailed logging for debugging

#### C. Improved Onboarding Route Session Handling
- Added immediate session saving when creating new user sessions
- Enhanced logging to track session creation and saving

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

**Improvements Made**:
- Added more detailed logging throughout the authentication flow
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging
- Added session ID logging for tracking session issues
- Improved email error handling to not break the signup flow

## Environment Configuration Verified

The following environment variables are properly configured:
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production`
- ✅ `SESSION_SECRET` (set)
- ✅ `EMAIL_USER=fitwithai18@gmail.com`
- ✅ `EMAIL_PASS` (set with app password)

## Testing Results

After applying the fixes:
1. ✅ Nodemailer imports and creates transporter correctly
2. ✅ Email service initializes without errors
3. ✅ Email connection test passes
4. ✅ Environment variables are properly loaded

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Monitor Logs**: Check the application logs to ensure sessions are being created and maintained properly
2. **Test Email Functionality**: Verify that welcome emails are being sent successfully
3. **Session Persistence**: Monitor that users can complete onboarding and access protected routes
4. **Consider HTTPS**: For production, consider enabling secure cookies once HTTPS is properly configured

## Files Modified

1. `/services/emailService.js` - Fixed nodemailer method name
2. `/app.js` - Updated session configuration and enhanced error handling
3. `/FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This documentation file

## Rollback Instructions

If issues persist, the main changes can be reverted by:
1. Changing `nodemailer.createTransport` back to `nodemailer.createTransporter` (though this would break functionality)
2. Reverting session configuration to previous settings
3. Removing additional logging statements

However, these fixes address the root causes of the reported issues and should improve application stability.
